## Projects

- ### How Should I Invest It: A Visualization Approach of Business Location Recommendation
  Developed an application that enables potential business owners choose the geographic location of new businesses. Various approaches like sentiment analysis, LDA topic modeling and K-means clustering were used to study and visualize business data from the Yelp dataset.


- ### Artistic Strokes for Images
  Built an application to render painted versions of photographs. The final image is formed by merging multiple layers of painterly layers each layer represents an image rendered with brush strokes of a specific radius, using different style parameters to simulate strokes in various styles like Impressionist, Expressionist, Colorist Wash, Pointillist or a Generic style.
  
- ### Patient Nutrition Tool
  Built a web application for hospitals to enable customized nutrition and diet restrictions of patients based on their medical history of allergies and medication.
  
- ### Heal-thy-body: Planning healthy meals on the go
  Conducted user research to investigate the problems faced by people from diverse backgrounds and occupations, in maintaining a healthy and nutritious diet. Developed a working prototype of a weekly meal planner for people who travel frequently, enabling people to source healthy meals for themselves while traveling, as well as their dear ones at home. Meals would be recommended taking into account the weekly budget and dietary preferences, while tracking the number of calories and nutritional components.
